# Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them: GitLab CI/CD

Welcome to this deep dive into **GitLab CI/CD**. In this article, we'll focus on **common pitfalls and how to avoid them**, a critical aspect for any senior engineer.

## Introduction

As software systems grow in complexity, mastering GitLab CI/CD becomes essential. We'll explore how common pitfalls and how to avoid them plays a pivotal role in modern development cycles.

## Core Concepts

Understanding the fundamentals is just the beginning. To truly excel, one must understand how these components interact in a production environment.

### Key Takeaways:
- Efficient implementation of GitLab CI/CD patterns.
- Strategic approach to common pitfalls and how to avoid them.
- Real-world application and scalability.

## Implementation Example

Here is a typical implementation skeleton:

```typescript
// Advanced GitLab CI/CD implementation
async function handleProcess() {
  try {
    const result = await executeAction("GitLab CI/CD", "Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them");
    console.log("Success:", result);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Critical failure in GitLab CI/CD:", error);
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Keep it modular**: Decouple logic from infrastructure.
2. **Prioritize performance**: Always measure before and after changes.
3. **Security first**: Never compromise on validation and hardening.

## Conclusion

Mastering **Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them** in **GitLab CI/CD** is a journey, not a destination. Stay updated with the latest changes and always keep experimenting.
