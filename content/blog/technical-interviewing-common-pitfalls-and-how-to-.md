# Technical Interviewing Pitfalls: Why You're Hiring the Wrong Engineers

Hiring is the most expensive decision a company makes. Yet, most technical interviews are designed in a way that produces high **False Negative** rates (rejecting good candidates) and, worse, **False Positives** (hiring candidates who can pass an interview but can't build a product).

As an Engineering Leader, you must recognize these common pitfalls to build a fair, effective, and diagnostic hiring loop.

## 1. The "LeetCode Trap": Algorithm Over Engineering

The most common mistake is over-indexing on algorithmic puzzles that have zero relevance to the job.
- **The Pitfall**: Asking a candidate to invert a binary tree for a React Frontend role.
- **The Reality**: You are measuring their ability to memorize computer science trivia, not their ability to manage state, build responsive UIs, or optimize render performance.
- **The Solution**: Tailor the coding task to the environment. If they are an Infrastructure Engineer, ask them to model a deployment pipeline.

## 2. The "Mirror Bias": Hiring Yourself

We naturally tend to like people who think like us, went to the same university, or use the same IDE.
- **The Pitfall**: Confusing "Cultural Fit" with "Personal Similarity." 
- **The Reality**: This leads to a homogenous team that lacks the diverse perspectives needed to solve complex problems.
- **The Solution**: Use a **Structured Interview Rubric**. Define exactly what "success" looks like for each question before the interview starts.

## 3. The "Power Trip" Interviewer

Some interviewers view the session as a way to prove how smart they are by asking "Gotcha" questions.
- **The Pitfall**: Asking extremely obscure questions with only one "correct" answer.
- **The Reality**: This creates a hostile environment that scares away high-quality, empathetic senior talent.
- **The Solution**: Train your interviewers to be **Facilitators**. The goal is to help the candidate show their best work, not to find the one thing they don't know.

## 4. Neglecting "Architecture and Design"

Many interviews focus so much on the "how" (code) that they forget the "why" (design).
- **The Pitfall**: Never asking about data modeling, scalability, or trade-offs.
- **The Reality**: A senior engineer who writes perfect code but designs a system that crashes under load is a liability.
- **The Solution**: Dedicate at least 45 minutes to a pure System Design discussion. Ask them to defend their choices of database, caching strategy, and communication protocols.

## 5. Poor Feedback Loops

The interview doesn't end when the candidate leaves.
- **The Pitfall**: Writing vague feedback like "They seemed smart" or "I didn't like their vibe."
- **The Reality**: Vague feedback makes it impossible for the hiring manager to make a data-driven decision.
- **The Solution**: Require **Evidence-Based Feedback**. Instead of "They know React," write "They successfully implemented a custom hook to handle complex API state and correctly explained the implications of `useEffect` dependencies."

## Conclusion

Technical interviewing is a core engineering competency. By avoiding the LeetCode trap, neutralizing bias, and focusing on real-world representative tasks, you can transform your hiring process from a game of chance into a strategic advantage. Remember: You aren't just hiring a "coder"—you're hiring a future colleague, mentor, and leader.
