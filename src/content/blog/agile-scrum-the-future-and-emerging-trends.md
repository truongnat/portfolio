# The Future of Agile: No-Estimates, Mob Programming, and AI

Scrum has been the dominant methodology for 15 years. But what comes next? Radical new approaches are challenging the status quo, optimizing for flow and collective intelligence over individual efficiency.

## 1. The #NoEstimates Movement

Estimating is often waste. We spend hours arguing if a ticket is a "3" or a "5", and we are usually wrong anyway.
**The Alternative:** Break all work down into small chunks (1 day or less). Then, simply count the number of items delivered.
**The Logic:** Over a large sample size, the variance averages out. Throughput (items/week) is a more reliable predictor than Velocity (points/week).

## 2. Mob Programming (Ensemble Programming)

Pair programming involves two people. **Mob Programming** involves the *whole team* working on *one computer* at the same time.
*   **The Driver:** Types the code.
*   **The Navigators:** Everyone else reviews, designs, and thinks ahead.
*   **Why it works:** It eliminates code review queues, knowledge silos, and context switching. "Flow efficiency" hits 100%.

## 3. Dynamic Reteaming

Traditional wisdom says "Keep teams stable." Heidi Helfand challenges this in her book *Dynamic Reteaming*.
**The Concept:** Allow people to move between teams based on their interests and the work required. This spreads knowledge and prevents stagnation.

## 4. AI-Driven Development

Generative AI is shifting the bottleneck.
*   **Old Constraint:** Typing code and remembering syntax.
*   **New Constraint:** Reviewing code, architectural design, and verifying correctness.

Agile in the AI era will look less like "writing stories" and more like "prompt engineering specifications." The definition of a "Developer" is shifting toward "Architect/Editor."

## Conclusion

The future of Agile is not about more rigorous adherence to Scrum Guide. It is about **Flow**. Whether it's removing the friction of estimation, or removing the friction of code review via Mobbing, the goal remains: Fluid, continuous delivery of value.
