# The Future of LangGraph: Multi-Agent Workflows and Self-Correction

LangGraph has set the standard for stateful agents. But we are only at the beginning of what "Graph-based" intelligence can achieve.

## 1. Collaborative Multi-Agent Graphs

Instead of one agent trying to do everything, we will see graphs where different nodes are powered by different specialized models (e.g., a "Vision" node using Gemini and a "Reasoning" node using GPT-4).

## 2. Self-Evolving Workflows

Imagine a graph that can **modify its own edges**. If an agent discovers that a certain sequence of tools is more efficient, it could update the graph structure for future runs.

## 3. Agentic Operating Systems

LangGraph will evolve into a "Kernel" for AI. It will manage the scheduling of tasks, the persistence of memory, and the communication between different agents, much like an OS manages hardware and processes.

## 4. Universal Human-in-the-loop Standards

We will see standard protocols for "Agentic Interrupts," allowing any UI (mobile, web, VR) to easily connect to a running LangGraph thread to provide approval or guidance.

## Conclusion

The future is **Stateful**. By providing the framework for persistence and cyclical reasoning, LangGraph is enabling the transition from "AI as a consultant" to "AI as a coworker."
