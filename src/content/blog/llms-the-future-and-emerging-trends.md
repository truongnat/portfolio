# Beyond Transformers: Mamba, Reasoning, and Embodiment

Transformers have dominated for 7 years. But they have a weakness: the quadratic cost of attention.

## 1. State Space Models (Mamba / Jamba)

**Mamba** is a new architecture that offers linear scaling.
*   **The Promise:** Millions of tokens of context with constant inference speed.
*   **The Impact:** Analyzing entire genomes or days of video footage in real-time.

## 2. System 2 Reasoning (Q*)

Current models are "System 1" (Fast, intuitive). The next frontier is **System 2** (Slow, deliberative).
*   **The Future:** Models that "pause to think," exploring multiple decision trees (like AlphaGo) before outputting a single token.

## 3. Embodied AI

Moving from "Chat" to "Action."
*   **Robotics:** Using LLMs to plan high-level tasks ("Clean the kitchen") and translating them into low-level motor controls.

## Conclusion

We are in the "GPT-3 moment" of Robotics and Biology. The techniques we learned for text are about to be applied to the physical world, unlocking a new wave of innovation.
