# The Future of OpenAI: Agents, Voice, and AGI

OpenAI's roadmap is clear: moving from "Chat" to "Action."

## 1. The "Operator" Model

The next generation of models won't just output text; they will use your computer.
*   **The Vision:** "Computer Use" capability where the model clicks buttons and types in browsers to book flights or fill out forms.

## 2. Voice-Native Computing

With the Real-time API, we are entering the era of *Her*.
*   **The Shift:** Latency will drop to <100ms. Voice assistants will be interruptible, emotional, and context-aware.

## 3. The Commoditization of Intelligence

As "Reasoning" becomes cheap (dropping 50% in price every year), the value shifts to **Context**. The winner is not the one with the best model, but the one who has the most data to feed the model.

## Conclusion

We are in the "Dial-up Era" of AI. The future is always-on, multi-modal, and deeply integrated into the OS layer of our lives.
