# The Future of React Native: Nitro Modules and Universal Apps

React Native is moving toward **Zero-Overhead Native Access**.

## 1. Nitro Modules (The 3rd Gen)

TurboModules were a great step, but **Nitro Modules** are the future.
*   **The Difference:** Nitro uses even more advanced C++ templates to generate boilerplate-free code.
*   **The Benefit:** Calling a Swift or Kotlin function from JS will be as fast as calling a local JS function.

## 2. Universal Apps (Expo for Web)

The dream of "Write Once, Run Anywhere" is finally real.
*   **The Trend:** Expo is making the "Web" target a first-class citizen. You build your app once and deploy it as a Website, an iOS app, and an Android app.

## 3. Direct Native View Integration

Instead of trying to replicate Native UI in JS, React Native is making it easier to wrap **SwiftUI** and **Jetpack Compose** components directly.
*   **The Future:** You build the complex, performance-critical "Core" of your app in SwiftUI, and use React Native for the orchestration and business logic.

## 4. AI-Driven Mobile Development

Imagine a tool that converts a Figma design into a fully-functional React Native component with Reanimated gestures already configured.
*   **The Impact:** Reducing the time-to-market for complex mobile apps from months to weeks.

## Conclusion

The future of React Native is **Ubiquity**. It is no longer just a way to avoid writing Java; it is the most efficient platform for building high-performance, universal applications across all screens.
