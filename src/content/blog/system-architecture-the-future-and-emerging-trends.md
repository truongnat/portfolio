# The Future of Architecture: Edge, Wasm, and AI

The "Cloud" is changing. We are moving away from massive centralized data centers toward a more distributed, intelligent fabric.

## 1. Edge Computing
Moving logic to the "CDN" layer.
*   **The Benefit:** 10ms latency. Code runs in the city where the user lives.

## 2. WebAssembly (Wasm) on the Server
Wasm is not just for browsers. It's a secure, ultra-fast, lightweight sandbox that starts in microseconds.
*   **The Future:** Wasm modules as the next evolution of Containers.

## 3. AI-Native Infrastructure
Databases that automatically optimize their own indexes based on query patterns. Load balancers that use machine learning to predict traffic spikes before they happen.

## Conclusion
The architect of 2030 will be an **Orchestrator** of highly intelligent, autonomous services that reside at the edge of the network.
