# Engineering Mentorship: A Case Study in Scaling Talent

One of the most critical responsibilities of an Engineering Leader is not writing code, but building the people who do. This case study explores a structured mentorship framework implemented at a rapidly growing tech startup.

## The Challenge: Onboarding Friction

As we scaled from 15 to 50 engineers, we noticed a significant drop in "time-to-first-PR." New hires were feeling lost, and senior engineers were being interrupted constantly with ad-hoc questions.

## The Solution: The "Sponsorship" Framework

We moved away from casual "buddies" to a formal **Sponsorship** model.

1.  **Technical Mentor:** Focused on the codebase, architecture, and PR reviews.
2.  **Culture Sponsor:** Focused on navigation, stakeholders, and career growth.

## Key Results

| Metric | Before | After |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Time to 1st PR** | 12 Days | 4 Days |
| **eNPS (Engineering)** | +15 | +42 |
| **Documentation Coverage** | 20% | 85% |

## Lesson Learned

Mentorship is a skill that must be taught. We provided mentors with a "Mentorship Playbook" and allocated 10% of their weekly capacity to these activities.
