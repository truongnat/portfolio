# Advanced Mentorship: Sponsorship, Coaching, and Psychological Safety

Mentorship in engineering is often misunderstood as simply "explaining the code." For senior leaders, mentorship is a strategic tool for organizational design.

## 1. Sponsorship vs. Mentorship

*   **Mentors** talk *to* you. They give advice and share knowledge.
*   **Sponsors** talk *about* you. They advocate for you in rooms you aren't in, securing high-visibility projects and promotions.

## 2. The GROW Model for Coaching

Instead of giving answers, use the GROW framework to help engineers find their own solutions:

*   **Goal:** What do you want to achieve?
*   **Reality:** What is the current situation?
*   **Options:** What could you do?
*   **Will:** What *will* you do next?

## 3. Engineering Psychological Safety

An elite mentor creates a space where it's safe to say "I don't know." High-performing teams are built on the foundation that mistakes are learning opportunities, not firing offenses.

## Conclusion

The goal of advanced mentorship is to make yourself redundant. If your team can solve complex problems and lead their own initiatives without your constant input, you have succeeded.
