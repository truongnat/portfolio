# The 5 Silent Killers of Engineering Mentorship

Even with the best intentions, mentorship can often do more harm than good if it falls into these common traps.

## 1. The Hero Complex

**The Pitfall:** The mentor solves every hard bug themselves "to save time," denying the mentee the struggle required for growth.
**The Fix:** Use the "hands-off" rule. Never touch the mentee's keyboard. Guide them with questions, not keystrokes.

## 2. The Advice Trap

**The Pitfall:** Jumping to solutions before understanding the context.
**The Fix:** Use the "Stay Curious a Little Longer" rule. Ask "And what else?" at least three times before offering a suggestion.

## 3. Lack of Structure

**The Pitfall:** Meetings that are just "catch-ups" with no clear goals.
**The Fix:** Use a Shared Growth Document. Track goals, blockers, and specific learning milestones.

## 4. The Knowledge Silo

**The Pitfall:** The mentor becomes the only source of truth.
**The Fix:** "Document to Delegate." If a mentee asks a question, point them to the documentation. If the docs don't exist, have the *mentee* write them as their first task.

## 5. Ignoring Soft Skills

**The Pitfall:** Focusing 100% on syntax and 0% on communication and stakeholder management.
**The Fix:** Bring mentees into high-level strategy meetings as observers.
