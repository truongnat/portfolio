# The Cognitive Science of Mentorship

Effective mentorship is grounded in educational psychology. To teach a junior engineer effectively, you must understand how they process information.

## 1. The Dreyfus Model of Skill Acquisition

Engineers move through five stages:
1.  **Novice:** Needs recipes and rules.
2.  **Advanced Beginner:** Starts to see patterns.
3.  **Competent:** Can plan and troubleshoot.
4.  **Proficient:** Has holistic view.
5.  **Expert:** Operates on intuition.

**Mentor Strategy:** Don't give a Novice a "holistic view"—you will overwhelm them. Give them rules. Don't give an Expert rules—you will frustrate them.

## 2. Managing Cognitive Load

Learning to code involves three types of load:
*   **Intrinsic:** The complexity of the problem itself.
*   **Extraneous:** The complexity of the environment (bad docs, noisy Slack).
*   **Germane:** The effort of building permanent mental models.

**Mentor Role:** Your job is to minimize **Extraneous** load so the mentee can focus their limited mental energy on **Germane** learning.

## 3. The Power of "Mental Models"

Instead of teaching "how to use React," teach the mental model of "declarative UI vs. imperative UI." Models last forever; APIs change every year.
