# Modern Mentorship: AI, Remote, and Async Growth

The 1-on-1 coffee chat is no longer the only way to grow a team. The modern engineering stack provides new opportunities for high-fidelity mentorship.

## 1. AI-Assisted Mentorship

Don't ban AI; mentor engineers on how to use it.
*   **The Reviewer:** Have the mentee use an LLM to explain a complex codebase, then have them present that explanation to you for verification.
*   **The Scaffold:** Use AI to generate unit test boilerplate so the mentee can focus on the logic.

## 2. The Pull Request as a Classroom

The PR is the most frequent touchpoint.
*   **Nit-picking vs. Architectural Advice:** Avoid minor syntax nits. Focus your comments on *why* a certain design pattern was chosen.
*   **Video PR Reviews:** Record a 2-minute Loom walking through the code. It adds tone and nuance that text lacks.

## 3. Data-Driven Growth

Use tools like **Linear** or **Pluralsight Flow** to track trends (not for surveillance, but for support). If an engineer's PR cycle time is spiking, it's time for a supportive check-in, not a performance review.
