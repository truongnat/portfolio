# Optimizing the Mentorship Loop: ROI and Feedback

Mentorship is an investment. Like any investment, it should be optimized for the best return (team growth).

## 1. The 1-on-1 Optimization

Stop using 1-on-1s for status updates (those belong in Slack).
*   **The 10/10/10 Rule:** 10 mins for the mentee, 10 mins for the mentor, 10 mins for the future.

## 2. Measuring Success

How do you know if mentorship is working?
*   **Qualitative:** "I feel more confident in our CI/CD pipeline."
*   **Quantitative:** Reduction in "Average Comments per PR" over 6 months.

## 3. The 360-Feedback Loop

Mentorship shouldn't be top-down. Ask your mentee:
*   "What is one thing I could do differently to help you learn faster?"
*   "Am I giving too much or too little direction?"

## Summary

Optimize for **Independence**. The metric of a perfect mentor is that they are no longer needed.
