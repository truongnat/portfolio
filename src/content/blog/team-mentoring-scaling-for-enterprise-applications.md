# Enterprise Mentorship: Scaling Growth to 100+ Engineers

In a large organization, individual mentorship doesn't scale. You need a **System of Growth**.

## 1. The Mentorship Guild

Create a cross-team group of senior engineers who share best practices for teaching. This ensures a consistent experience regardless of which team a new hire joins.

## 2. Cross-Team Rotations

One of the best ways to mentor is to have an engineer spend one sprint in another team.
*   **Benefits:** Breaks silos, spreads architectural knowledge, and builds empathy between teams.

## 3. The "Paved Road" for Learning

Centralize learning resources.
*   **The Learning Path:** A curated list of courses and internal docs for every role (e.g., "Senior Backend Track").
*   **Internal Tech Talks:** Monthly sessions where engineers teach each other what they've learned.

## Conclusion

Scaling talent is the only way to scale an enterprise. If you only hire senior talent, you will run out of money. If you hire and *grow* junior talent, you create a sustainable engine.
