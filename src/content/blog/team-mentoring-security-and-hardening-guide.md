# Mentoring for Security: Building a Culture of Hardened Code

Security isn't a department; it's a habit. As a mentor, your goal is to help your mentees see vulnerabilities before they write them.

## 1. The "Adversarial Mindset"

Teach mentees to think like an attacker. During code reviews, don't just ask "Does this work?". Ask "How could I break this?"

## 2. Security "Lunch and Learns"

Pick a recent high-profile vulnerability (e.g., Log4Shell) and walk through *exactly* how it happened and how it was fixed. Understanding the "Why" is better than memorizing OWASP Top 10.

## 3. Pairing on Hardening

When a vulnerability is found in your own code, don't just fix it. **Pair on the fix.** Explain the trade-offs between different mitigation strategies.

## Summary

A secure team is a team that knows *why* they are adding validation, not just one that follows a security scanner's output.
