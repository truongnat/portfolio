# The Art of the Technical Interview: A Rubric-Based Approach

Hiring is the most expensive thing a company does. Yet, most technical interviews are inconsistent, biased, and poor predictors of actual job performance. This case study details how we transformed our hiring process into a data-driven system.

## The Problem: "Gut Feeling" Hiring

Our original process relied on engineers asking their favorite "riddle" or LeetCode question.
*   **Result:** We hired people who were good at competitive programming but struggled with our React/Node.js codebase.
*   **Bias:** Interviewers tended to favor candidates who shared their same educational background or "vibed" well during the call.

## The Solution: Structured Rubrics

We eliminated "Pass/Fail" and replaced it with a 1-4 competency rubric for every session.

### Example Rubric: System Design
1.  **Novice:** Cannot explain basic load balancing; ignores data consistency.
2.  **Competent:** Understands 3-tier architecture; can suggest a database choice.
3.  **Proficient:** Deep dive into caching strategies, rate limiting, and trade-offs.
4.  **Expert:** Identifies obscure failure modes; suggests elegant, cost-effective scaling solutions.

## The Results

| Metric | Before | After |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Offer Acceptance Rate** | 60% | 85% |
| **90-Day Retention** | 75% | 98% |
| **Diversity in Pipeline** | 12% | 35% |

## Lesson Learned

A good interview should feel like a collaborative working session, not an interrogation. If the candidate is stuck, a good interviewer provides a hint to see how they process new information—this is more valuable than seeing if they can memorize an algorithm.
