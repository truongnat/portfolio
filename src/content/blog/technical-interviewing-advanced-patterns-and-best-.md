# Advanced Interviewing: Behavioral Signals and Senior Signals

When hiring a Junior, you look for aptitude and curiosity. When hiring a Senior or Staff Engineer, the technical skills are table stakes. You must interview for **Impact** and **Influence**.

## 1. The Behavioral "Deep Dive"

Instead of "Tell me about a time you had a conflict," use the **Topgrading** method. Walk through their entire career chronologically.
*   "Who was your manager at [Company X]? What would they say are your three biggest strengths? What were your biggest failures?"

## 2. The Architectural "Pinhole"

Don't ask them to build Twitter. Ask them to design a very specific component of a system they claim to have built.
*   "You mentioned you built the notification service. How did you handle idempotency at the database layer? Why did you choose SQS over RabbitMQ for that specific use case?"

## 3. The "Code Review" Interview

Instead of having them write code, give them a PR with 5 deliberate architectural flaws.
*   **What to look for:** Do they find the security bug? Are they kind in their feedback? Do they suggest a refactor or just fix the syntax?

## Summary

Senior engineers are force multipliers. Your interview must determine if they make everyone around them better, or if they are just a "Brilliant Jerk."
