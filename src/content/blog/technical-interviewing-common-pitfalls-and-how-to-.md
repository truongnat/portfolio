# The 5 Hiring Mistakes That Cost You Top Talent

Most interview processes are designed to "filter out the bad" rather than "find the great." This defensive posture often results in a boring, stressful experience that alienates top-tier talent.

## 1. The Brainteaser Trap

**The Mistake:** Asking riddles or obscure math problems that have nothing to do with day-to-day engineering.
**The Result:** You hire people who are good at riddles, not people who build reliable systems.

## 2. The "Interrogator" Persona

**The Mistake:** Rapid-fire questioning without context or conversation.
**The Fix:** Make it a "Pair Programming" session. The goal is to see how the candidate collaborates.

## 3. Lack of Feedback Loops

**The Mistake:** Never asking the candidates for feedback on the process.
**The Fix:** Send a 2-question survey after the final round: "Did you feel the interview was relevant to the role? Was the interviewer professional?"

## 4. The "Culture Fit" Excuse

**The Mistake:** Using "Culture Fit" as a vague reason to reject people who don't look or act like the current team.
**The Fix:** Interview for "Culture Add." What new perspective or skill does this person bring that we lack?

## 5. Slow Time-to-Offer

**The Mistake:** Letting a candidate sit for 2 weeks between rounds.
**The Reality:** The best engineers are off the market in 10 days. If you like someone, move at "startup speed."
