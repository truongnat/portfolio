# The Science of Selection: Predictive Validity in Hiring

In 1998, Schmidt and Hunter published a landmark meta-analysis on what actually predicts job performance. The results were shocking to many managers.

## 1. What Works (High Validity)
*   **Work Sample Tests (0.54):** Giving someone a task that is 90% similar to the actual job.
*   **Structured Interviews (0.51):** Asking everyone the same questions and using a rubric.
*   **General Cognitive Ability (0.51):** Problem-solving speed and logic.

## 2. What Doesn't (Low Validity)
*   **Years of Experience (0.18):** Surprisingly low correlation after the first 2-3 years.
*   **Education Level (0.10):** Where you went to school has almost zero impact on your actual output.
*   **Unstructured Interviews (0.38):** Just "having a chat" is only slightly better than a coin flip.

## 3. The "Halo Effect"

This is a cognitive bias where our overall impression of a person ("They are so nice!") influences our evaluation of their specific traits ("They must be a great coder").
**The Cure:** Split the interview panels. The person who tests "Coding" should not be the same person who tests "System Design." This prevents one bad (or good) session from tainting the entire score.
