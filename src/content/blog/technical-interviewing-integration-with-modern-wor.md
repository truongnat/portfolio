# The Modern Hiring Stack: AI, Remote, and Automated Assessments

The era of flying candidates to an office to draw on a whiteboard is over. The modern hiring process is fast, remote, and increasingly data-driven.

## 1. Dealing with AI in Interviews

Candidates *will* use AI. Instead of trying to "block" it (which is impossible), incorporate it.
*   **The Prompting Challenge:** Give them a complex task and let them use AI. Evaluate their ability to *verify* the output and *refine* the prompts. This is a real-world skill.

## 2. Automated Screening (The First Filter)

To handle 1000s of applications, you need automation.
*   **Tools:** Byteboard, CodeSignal.
*   **The Key:** Ensure the automated test is relevant. A React developer should not be filtered out because they can't remember how to invert a binary tree in 30 minutes.

## 3. High-Fidelity Remote Interviews

Use platforms like **CoderPad** or **Woven**.
*   **Pro Tip:** Use a tool that allows the candidate to bring their own IDE settings. They should be as comfortable as possible to show their best work.

## Summary

The modern stack is about **efficiency**. Reduce the time your senior engineers spend on low-quality interviews by using high-quality automated filters early in the process.
