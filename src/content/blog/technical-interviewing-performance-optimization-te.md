# Optimizing the Hiring Pipeline: Metrics and Bottlenecks

A slow hiring process is a broken hiring process. If you want to hire the best, you need to treat your recruiting pipeline with the same engineering rigor as your CI/CD pipeline.

## 1. The Funnel Metrics

*   **Sourcing Conversion:** (Interviews / Total Applications). If this is low, your Job Description is too vague.
*   **Technical Pass Rate:** (Passed Technical / Total Technical). If this is >70%, your test is too easy. If <10%, your sourcing is wrong.
*   **Offer Acceptance Rate:** If this is <80%, your compensation or "sell" is failing.

## 2. Identifying the "Drop-off"

Track where candidates are withdrawing.
*   **Withdrawal after Take-home:** Your take-home is too long (Limit it to 2-3 hours).
*   **Withdrawal after Onsite:** Your interviewers are likely being rude or the process is too exhausting.

## 3. Cost-per-Hire (CPH)

Don't forget the hidden cost of engineer time. If 5 engineers spend 4 hours each on an interview loop, that's $2,000+ in salary alone. Optimize the process to ensure you only spend that time on high-probability candidates.
