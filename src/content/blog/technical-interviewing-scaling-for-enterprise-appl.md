# Enterprise Hiring: Scaling Quality at Volume

When you need to hire at scale, the biggest risk is "The Bozo Explosion"—where mediocre people hire even more mediocre people, and quality spirals downward.

## 1. The "Bar Raiser" Program

Popularized by Amazon, a Bar Raiser is an experienced interviewer from *outside* the hiring team who has veto power.
*   **The Goal:** To ensure that the candidate is better than 50% of the current people in that role. They prevent "desperation hiring" to fill a seat.

## 2. Interviewer Certification

Don't let just any engineer interview.
*   **The Shadow Path:** A new interviewer must shadow 3 sessions, then be "Reverse Shadowed" (they lead, senior observes) for 3 sessions before they can interview solo.

## 3. Question Banks and Rotation

To prevent questions from leaking to Glassdoor and to ensure consistency across teams (e.g., London vs. San Francisco), use a centralized, rotating bank of validated questions.

## Conclusion

Scaling hiring is a management challenge, not a technical one. It requires clear standards, constant training, and a refusal to compromise on the bar for the sake of speed.
