# The Future of Technical Hiring: Simulations and AI

The "Algorithm Interview" is dying. As AI becomes better at writing code, the value of a human developer is shifting from "knowing syntax" to "solving complex problems."

## 1. Simulation-Based Assessments

Imagine an interview that is a 4-hour flight simulator for an SRE. You are dropped into a "broken" cloud environment and have to fix it while dealing with "stakeholder" messages. This is the future of work-sample testing.

## 2. AI as the Interviewer (and Assistant)

*   **AI Interviewers:** Can conduct initial screenings at 2 AM, asking follow-up questions based on the candidate's specific answers.
*   **AI Assistants:** Candidates will be expected to use AI. The evaluation will be on how well they steer the AI to build a correct, secure system.

## 3. The "Portfolio" over the "Resume"

Verified contributions to Open Source and a history of public technical writing will carry more weight than a degree from a prestigious university.

## Conclusion

Hiring is becoming more **Authentic**. The goal is moving toward seeing the candidate in their "natural habitat"—solving real problems with real tools.
